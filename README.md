# PDF to Audio

A small Python project for beginners :)

The program is able to scan PDFs documents and create a Audio file with all the content
inside the PDF file. Make sure you **add the PDF file in the correct path**, otherwise the program will fail to run. There is a possibility to change the Audio lenguage as well.

_Happy coding :p_
